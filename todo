 - hello together. I made a new app to handle the microservice Actions.

   Please pull the latest Version

   I also added memcached as a Service to the docker-compose file. Please do a docke-compose up in order to get that memcached installed, followed by <ctrl>+<c> and docker-compose start

   Inside the icop (root) Folder do:
   - dep ensure
   - go build
   you will now have a icop executable

   You can start all Services by doing:
   - icop run

   You can run the migrations by doing:
   - icop migrate --down
   and
   - icop migrate

   You can rebuild all Services by doing:
   - icop build

   I tested this with dani on Linux and Windows. Please let me know, if it's working for you also
